## "I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge"
[FAILED... 19% - 2021 ARCHIVE]<br>
Not unlike many persons, I decide in 2021 to start over and start my coding journey. <br>
Always appreciative of technology, I messed around with python, arduino and javascript a bit, but I never got far in my projects and ideas. That's the main reason I decided to change my habits for the better and relearn how to do things, starting with somethings I didn't quite know: HTML and CSS.<br><br>
What can be found here are my logs about my personal progress and some thoughs on it!

## Thanks
Kudos to what gives me the tools to learn and motivate myself.<br>
