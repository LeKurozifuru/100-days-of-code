## "I've [tried to join] the #100DaysOfCode Challenge"
A coding journey is not given point in someone's personal life. <br>
It is not made in a year, nor is it a perfect continious process traced in advance. <br> <br>
Always appreciative of technology, I messed around with coding before, but ever got far in my projects and ideas, now archived somewhere in a drive. That's the main reason I wish to attempt to this challenge again in the future, to complete my drafts and grow as a person.<br><br>
This repo will document my work, stuggles and thoughts on this journey.<br>
